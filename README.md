# VCS_pythontask

During my studies at Vilnius Coding School's data analytics program, I gained foundational knowledge of Python programming. As part of the course, I completed a capstone project focused on Lithuania's official statistics on infectious disease cases from 2010 onwards. The analysis was conducted using Python libraries such as pandas and matplotlib, allowing me to derive insights and present the findings visually. You can view my final project here.
